The process of converting an ER model of a database to a relational table is very easy and very small. The following steps can be followed in order to convert it.

1. Make an ER Model of the database.

2. Make a table with the same column names as of the attributes in the ER model.

3. Write all the simple attributes as it is, first at the start of the table.

4. For composite attributes, we are only supposed to write the attributes which make the composite attribute. We are not supposed to write the name of the composite attribute in the relational table.

5. For a multivalued attribute, a new table is formed in itself and then finally linked with the primary key of the main relational table.
